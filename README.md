# CUISkillBank-Immature-Repo
incomplete repo


Few things are yet to be done , if you know how to do that please do tell me.
0. SkillSet class is made to store multiple skills in array but this array is not yet in association with any other class .
1. Confirmation at the end of registration , if pressed yes then store data otherwise don't store it.
2. Make an list of array of skills to store multiple skills (Remove and add skills method is made ).
3. Admin class and compare skills there and assign data to section 4.
4. Chat box  between admin and volunteer(Make 2 string objects, 1 for volunteer to receive and send messge and 1 for admin to send and receive. Store one message at a time in Strings and when new message typed , old one will be removed ).
5. Community class (Which has nothing to do with volunteer and admin classes)(Simpliest one to make)
6. Director class/method to print statistical data that will include volunteers and their skills being offered to others and skills they are getting from them.
